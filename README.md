[NativeBase](http://nativebase.io/) is a free and open source framework that enables developers to build high-quality apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for iOS and Android with a fusion of ES6. NativeBase builds a layer on top of React Native that provides you with basic set of components for mobile application development. This helps you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms.

NativeBase without a doubt fits in well with mobile applications which cut downs one huge part of your app - The Front end.
The applications stack of components is built using native UI components, so there are no compromises with the user experience.
